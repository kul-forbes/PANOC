/*! \mainpage PANOC: Fast nonlinear model predictive control

 * 
 * \section panoc_about PANOC in a nutshell
 * 
 * This is a C implementation of PANOC, a Proximal Averaged Newton-type method for Optimal Control.
 * 
 * PANOC is a fast solver for nonlinear optimal control problems which arise in 
 * nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) and other applications.
 * 
 * Features of the method:
 * 
 * - Very fast convergence, <b>sub-millisecond-fast</b> MPC
 * - <b>Low memory</b> requirements
 * - Suitable for embedded applications
 * - Global convergence properties
 * - Not sensitive to ill conditioning
 * - Unlike SQP, does not require inner iterative procedures
 * 
 * Features of the implementation:
 * 
 * - <b>Dependency-free</b> C implementation (no libraries, <b>C89 standard</b>)
 * - Very easy to install
 * - Controller design in MATLAB, implementation in C (powered by 
 *   [CasADi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki))
 * - Unit-tested (very high [coverage](https://codecov.io/gh/kul-forbes/EmbeddedMPC))
 * - Memory-leak-free (checked with [valgrind](http://valgrind.org))
 * - Detailed documentation
 * - MEX interface for testing/simulation purposes (work in progress)
 * 
 * The main API with which end-users interact is provided in panoc.h.

 * \section panoc_obstacle_avoidance Obstacle avoidance
 * 
 * PANOC comes with a MATLAB toolbox that allows the design of obstacle avoidance
 * controllers based on nonlinear model predictive control while it produces C code
 * (following the C89 standard) which can be used on embedded devices.
 * 
 * Below we see a collection of trajectories from different initial points \f$(x_0, y_0)\f$
 * and different initial headings \f$\theta_0\f$ towards the target point \f$(x_r, y_r, \theta_r) = (3.5, 0.5, 0)\f$.
